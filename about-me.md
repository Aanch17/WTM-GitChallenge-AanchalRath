Hi, I’m Aanchal. Currently studying AIML and exploring my domain through DSAA, Python, OOPS, C++ and various other fields. 
I am passionate about learning new things and implementing them in life.
I find my solace in reading, writing and songs. 
Quite the simple yet busy life.

I want to join WTM because, I want to help others overcome their fear of coding and overcome some of my fears too. It'll help me gain the confidence which I can share with others one day so that they can push away that tiny nagging in their head that always says "it's scary and not possible". Because everything is possible, maybe later but sure one day at a time.
