I want to build a few beginner-friendly projects so I stop overthinking and start actually creating.  
Get more comfortable with Python, Git, and the basics of ML, instead of running away from them.  
Last but not the least take part in more events and communities so I don’t feel like I’m learning everything alone and through just reading.
