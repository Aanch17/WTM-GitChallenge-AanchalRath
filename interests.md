I’m mainly interested in AI/ML quiet obvious but its something im always interested in, how i can use it everyday and help.
I love reading and writing, while also listening to songs.
I like learning in spaces where people support each other instead of competing, brings a peace of mind instead of constant fights which helps in better outcomes.
I want to be part of communities that help girls feel less scared of tech and more confident in trying things out.
